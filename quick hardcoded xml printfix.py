# Purpose:  Quickly fix a printing issue with XML output by narrowing column 'F'

# fix it by decreasing F width by 200. Since we dont extract the string as is,
# replacing only desired parts in the whole XML is a quick fix.

# keyword that HAS to be in the filename
file_keyword = "IPV ("

# extention for new output file
custom_extention = " - edited automatically.xml"


# walk over files, fix XML and output as a new file.
